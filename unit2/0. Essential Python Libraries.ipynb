    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python. NumPy contains, among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tools for reading and writing array-based datasets to disk\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mature C API to enable Python extensions and native C or C++ code to access NumPy’s data structures and computational facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the fast array-processing capabilities that NumPy adds to Python, one of its primary uses in data analysis is as a container for data to be passed between algorithms and libraries. For numerical data, NumPy arrays are more efficient for storing and manipulating data than the other built-in Python data structures. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, such as C or Fortran, can operate on the data stored in a NumPy array without copying data into some other memory representation. Thus, many numerical computing tools for Python either assume NumPy arrays as a primary data structure or else target seamless interoperability with NumPy."

    "## pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. Since its emergence in 2010, it has helped enable Python to be a powerful and productive data analysis environment. The primary objects in pandas that will be used in this book are the DataFrame, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the Series, a one-dimensional labeled array object.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas blends the high-performance, array-computing ideas of NumPy with the flexible data manipulation capabilities of spreadsheets and relational databases (such as SQL). It provides sophisticated indexing functionality to make it easy to reshape, slice and dice, perform aggregations, and select subsets of data. Since data manipulation, preparation, and cleaning is such an important skill in data analysis, pandas is one of the primary focuses of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a bit of background, I started building pandas in early 2008 during my tenure at AQR Capital Management, a quantitative investment management firm. At the time, I had a distinct set of requirements that were not well addressed by any single tool at my disposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structures with labeled axes supporting automatic or explicit data alignment—this prevents common errors resulting from misaligned data and working with differently indexed data coming from different sources\n",
    "- Integrated time series functionality\n",
    "- The same data structures handle both time series data and non–time series data\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations and reductions that preserve metadata\n",
    "- Flexible handling of missing data\n",
    "- Merge and other relational operations found in popular databases (SQL-based, for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to be able to do all of these things in one place, preferably in a language well suited to general-purpose software development. Python was a good candidate language for this, but at that time there was not an integrated set of data structures and tools providing this functionality. As a result of having been built initially to solve finance and business analytics problems, pandas features especially deep time series functionality and tools well suited for working with time-indexed data generated by business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users of the R language for statistical computing, the DataFrame name will be familiar, as the object was named after the similar R data.frame object. Unlike Python, data frames are built into the R programming language and its standard library. As a result, many features found in pandas are typically either part of the R core implementation or provided by add-on packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas name itself is derived from panel data, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured datasets, and a play on the phrase Python data analysis itself."

    "\n",
    "matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other two-dimensional data visualizations. It was originally created by John D. Hunter and is now maintained by a large team of developers. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publication. While there are other visualization libraries available to Python programmers, matplotlib is the most widely used and as such has generally good integration with the rest of the ecosystem. I think it is a safe choice as a default visualization tool."

    "## IPython and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPython project began in 2001 as Fernando Pérez’s side project to make a better interactive Python interpreter. In the subsequent 16 years it has become one of the most important tools in the modern Python data stack. While it does not provide any computational or data analytical tools by itself, IPython is designed from the ground up to maximize your productivity in both interactive computing and software development. It encourages an execute-explore workflow instead of the typical edit-compile-run workflow of many other programming languages. It also provides easy access to your operating system’s shell and filesystem. Since much of data analysis coding involves exploration, trial and error, and iteration, IPython can help you get the job done faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014, Fernando and the IPython team announced the Jupyter project, a broader initiative to design language-agnostic interactive computing tools. The IPython web notebook became the Jupyter notebook, with support now for over 40 programming languages. The IPython system can now be used as a kernel (a programming language mode) for using Python with Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython itself has become a component of the much broader Jupyter open source project, which provides a productive environment for interactive and exploratory computing. Its oldest and simplest “mode” is as an enhanced Python shell designed to accelerate the writing, testing, and debugging of Python code. You can also use the IPython system through the Jupyter Notebook, an interactive web-based code “notebook” offering support for dozens of programming languages. The IPython shell and Jupyter notebooks are especially useful for data exploration and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebook system also allows you to author content in Markdown and HTML, providing you a means to create rich documents with code and text. Other programming languages have also implemented kernels for Jupyter to enable you to use languages other than Python in Jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me personally, IPython is usually involved with the majority of my Python work, including running, debugging, and testing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the accompanying book materials, you will find Jupyter notebooks containing all the code examples from each chapter."
